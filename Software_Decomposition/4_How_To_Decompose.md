Good decomposition means the net benefit is positive (opportunity cost). Even though there will always be some degree of coupling between parts, different designs can introduce different degree of coupling. And higher the degree of coupling is, the worse the design.

## Intuitiveness

Good abstraction: can infer the behavior from name.
Name has business meaning.

# Decomposition techniques

## Functional decomposition

Functional decomposition is a software design technique in which a complex system is broken down into smaller, more manageable parts, or modules, based on their functionality or behavior. Each module represents a specific function or task within the system, and is designed to operate independently of other modules.

Functional decomposition is commonly used in object-oriented programming and structured programming paradigms. In object-oriented programming, each module is implemented as a class that encapsulates a specific set of functionality. In structured programming, each module is implemented as a function or procedure that performs a specific task.
