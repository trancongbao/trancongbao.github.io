## Modular programming

> A modularized application may or may not be modular.

> **Modular programming** is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable **modules**, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.  
> A module **interface** expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module. The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. The **implementation** contains the working code that corresponds to the elements declared in the interface. (Wikipedia)

## Information hiding

- Prevent use by mistake (not common)
- Better automatic generation of interfaces documentation
- Better IDE suggestions
