# What are the potential benefits of decomposition?

Decomposition addresses the challenge of understanding and managing complexity. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts. Good decomposition allows us to solve each independently. In this way, the overall problem is solved or system is constructed by solving or designing each part and then combining them together.

## Comprehensibility

By dividing a complex problem into smaller parts, you can reduce the cognitive load, focus on one aspect at a time, and avoid getting lost in irrelevant details or assumptions. Breaking down complex problems also helps you to communicate more effectively with others, as you can explain your problem and your solution in a clear and logical way, and invite feedback and collaboration.

## Easier Changes

It should be possible to make drastic changes to one module without a need to change others: faster and less risky.

## Easier Coordination/Communication

Separate groups would work on each module with little need for communication.

## Reusability

A function can be re-used at many places.

## Test Isolation
