# What are the potential costs of decomposition

## Coupling

The different parts of an application cannot work alone. They need to connect with each other somehow in order to solve the problems. For example, one part of the application uses the result from another part. This "connection" is called **coupling**. This basically makes working with one part dependent on the other parts.

Couplings exist, whether the application is decomposed or not, or how granular the decomposition is. The business requirements necessitate a certain of coupling.

When it come to decomposition, the more coupling we have, the less benefit we can get from the decomposition.

### Coupling Types

#### Data coupling

This is probably the most severe coupling. Modules share data through, for example, parameters or global data.

Sometimes, modules share a composite data structure and use only parts of it, possibly different parts (e.g., passing a whole record to a function that needs only one field of it). In this situation, a modification in a field that a module does not need may lead to changing the way the module reads the record. There's even a term for this: **Stamp coupling**.

#### Control coupling

One part is executed depending on other parts.

#### Subclass coupling (OOP)

Describes the relationship between a child and its parent. The child is connected to its parent, but the parent is not connected to the child.

## Couplings reduce the benefit from decomposition

There more couplings, the less benefit we can get from decomposition. Sometimes, the net benefit can be negative: we're better off reducing the decompotiion granularity. There more couplings, the less benefit we can get from decomposition. 

- Cognitive load is not reduced as much, as we need to take into account dependent modules.
- Changes in one part are more likely to necessitate changes in other parts.
- Members/teams must communicate more closely if their modules.
- More difficult to isolate test.

## Coupling with decomposition introduce indirection

We now have indirection. For example, instead of seeing the code inline, we have to call a function and passing in the arguments. To understand what the function does, we need to rely on the function name which can be difficult to understand, misleading even: naming is not easy. So, sometimes, we need to read the documentation, which can also be difficult to understand or even misleading. So, sometimes, to be sure, we have to get to the function to read it. The function definition may locate in a different part of the module, or in a different module, different file, even a different repository.

In event-drivent architecture, asynchronous messaging communication, the communication is not direct and asynchronous.

## Decomposition introduces bad or premature abstraction

This can be both a benefit and a liability.
The abstract can be bad (OOP), premature.
